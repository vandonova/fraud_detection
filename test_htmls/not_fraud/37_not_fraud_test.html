   A celebration of Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center's first 100 years of moving families forward.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Please join us for breakfast on the very spot where MRNC was established 100 years ago, the new J.W. Marriott hotel in downtown Indianapolis. Share in the accomplishments of our first century--and get fired up to do more to bring help and hope to the families of Indianapolis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The featured speaker for the event will be Ron Hunter, the former basketball coach at IUPUI for 17 seasons and the current head basketball coach at Georgia State. Mr. Hunter is well-known for his dedication to providing help and hope to children in Indianapolis and across the world with his "barefoot coaching" which has attracted donations of thousands of shoes for Samaritan's Feet. In partnership with Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, Samaritan's Feet has provided hundreds of shoes to children and their parents in southwest Indianapolis over the past two years.
