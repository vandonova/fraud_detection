      I don't see a beach ride scheduled on the day/time when I want to ride. Should I schedule a Private Ride?
     </strong>
    </span>
    <span style="color: #d4d4d4; font-family: symbol;">
     This popular and unique riding experience sells out fast, and once an event sells out we take it off the website. The dates and times you see are what we have available. All times are based on low-tide.

     <strong>
      Who can participate in the beach experience?
     </strong>
    </span>
    <span style="color: #d4d4d4; font-family: symbol;">
     Almost anyone can do this because we can adjust the ride depending on your experience level. We make it wicked fun for Barneys and expert riders alike. We accept children as young as 3. We welcome the disabled. Our only restriction is that you must weight under 220 lbs. Sorry, no exceptions.

     <strong>
      I know how to ride, do I have to have a guide?
     </strong>
     If you can ride like a Comanche we'll let you ride on the beach without a guide, but everyone has a guide in the water. Sweet!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Will I ride bareback?
     </strong>
     Yes, but not like that! We use bareback pads which are more comfy than sitting directly on the horse (but no stirrups). English and western-style saddles are available, but cannot be taken into the salt water.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Can you accommodate more than 4 riders?
     </strong>
     Yes, but not at the same time.  If you have 8-15 riders in your party, we can organize a weapons-grade beach party for you. Call

      Can Junior ride with an adult?
     </strong>
     Yes. But there are restrictions. The adult must be an accomplished rider with years of riding instructions. The combined weight of the adult and child must be under 200 lbs. The child must hold a ticket. No free lunch, baby!

     How much should I tip?
    </strong>
    - Excellent question. If you're a cheap-skate or you have a really lousy time, $0-5 per person. If you're a working stiff or student like us, then $10-20 per person is average. If you have a truly awesome experience, then $25-50 per person is normal. If you flew into SRQ on a Gulfstream G550, then $100 each is very cool. All tips, no matter how small, are greatly appreciated.
