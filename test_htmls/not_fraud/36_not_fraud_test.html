   PENGUIN PRISON:

   Born and raised in Manhattan, the mecca of musical endeavors, Chris 
Glover aka Penguin Prison has never been short of inspiration, raised on
 a reasonably healthy diet of Michael Jackson, Prince, Tribe Called 
Quest, Nat King Cole, Nirvana and Weezer, he soon began to channel these
 influences, feeding them into his own musical ventures that quickly 
helped him make a name for himself. With a soulful voice and 
extraordinary ability to play just about every instrument within his 
reach, Glover soon entered the Professional Performing Arts School in 
NYC. He's 
being touted as "One to Watch" by BBC favorites Zane Lowe and Nick 
Grimshaw, as well as receiving a media shower of praise upon his 
outstandingly unique wonky-pop soul singles.

  <p>
   With influences spanning from Wu-Tang to Quincy Jones and Curbs' own 
Larry David (yes, you read that right), this witty pop-pioneer is 
currently working in the studio on his debut album, recording mostly on 
analogue equipment, collaborating on tracks with various musicians 
including Crispin Hunt (formerly of the longpigs), spending half his 
time recording in London with Dan Grech-Marguerat and New York City with
 fellow city dwellers Holy Ghost! The result, is a sound so ridiculously
 infectious, that you really shouldn't have to think about his music too
 much, although you probably will. So be prepared to riddle yourself 
silly for references to a sound that you canâ€™t quite put your finger on.
 It's fun, it's refreshing, and you'll damned if you can't stop 
listening to it.
