  <p>
   Cuddle Party is structured &amp; hosted in such a way that is empowering to the individual.
   <strong>
    Guiding you step by step
   </strong>
   of safe ways
   <strong>
    to look after your own needs and desires
   </strong>
   and to loosen up naturally
   <strong>
    and have a good time
   </strong>
   . This environment to
   <strong>
    boost self confidence
   </strong>
   , learn social interation that is simple and basic to apply (in all areas of your life) even out side of the event. You will also learn how to
   <strong>
    gently 
and safely push your ‘comfort zone’ boundaries
   </strong>
   to explore your 
intimate self and how to share that with one another.
  </p>
  <p>
   As human beings we not only have a
   <strong>
    deep desire to connect
   </strong>
   with one another ....but an innate 
need for affection, intimacy and most of all touch.
   <strong>
    To touch and be touched.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    in a 'non' sexual way.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   It is here at Cuddle Party that we show you how this can be non sexualy as we create an environment that recreates a child like state. One that promotes
   <strong>
    innocence and light heartedness and pure in intent
   </strong>
   . It's really simple!
  </p>
  <p>
   For some reason Western Culture both socially and culturally collasped and melded together that being loving, affectionate and/or 
intimate toward one another as being sexualised. Creating mixed messages of
 sexual attraction. Which in parcel, trigger many forms of inherent 
and/or learnt fears, concerns, anxieties, insecurities etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   At Cuddle Party you will learn how to take complete responsibility 
for your self and your needs via open, clear &amp; succinct communication skills, which we will show you.. You will be 
respected and will respect one another regardless of your current 
disposition. You will learn how to be 
specifically about your own personal needs and desires..
  </p>
  <p>
   All of which is founded by the Cuddle Party guidelines (aka the rules) 
which bring together a relative set of like minded strangers ‘all on the 
same page’, to very quickly become not so strange towards one another.
  </p>
  <p>
   This joyous event will have you laughing and crying. Certainly one event you will never forget.
  </p>
  <p>
   There’s something very magical, about Cuddle Party that has been known to be both therapeutic and healing all packed into this usually two - three hour playspace.
