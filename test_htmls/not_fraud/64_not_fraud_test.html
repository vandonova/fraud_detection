   It's September, and after being baked
in July we were nearly drowned in August. Despite God's best attempts
however, the Non-Productive Comedy Show lives on! We will thrill and
excite once again, and barring more of God's Wrath, it will not be
canceled! This month we have a special guest singer, Cats and
kittens, the rebirth of cool movement is going strong, are you
jumping on-board yet?

   Hosted by comedian John Minus and
blogger N'Jaila Rhee, and backed by the comedy network
Non-Productive.com, the retro comedy show with sex appeal will be at
its explosive best this month. The formula is simple: take two
terrifically sexy hosts, add

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
   8 of the best looking and most
hilarious comedians in New York City, sprinkle liberally with Pinup
girls who may be enticed into disrobing at any given time, and give
away some free stuff, including a bottle of Nude Vodka. We have it
down to a science here, the science of putting on a great show!

“Derik began performing stand up in 2004 after winning a comedy
contest at the Gypsy Comedy Club in St. Augustine, Florida.” He
started out winning! He will have the home field advantage as he
hosts a weekly open mic at Tobacco Road on Wednesday night. He is
also a terrible racist. Meaning he is terrible at racism. You can

   Rashad Bashir – Barely wet behind the
ears comedy-wise, Rashad has taken the city by storm, even finagling
his way onto the NPCS once before. He greatly impressed the audience
with his geek-influenced comedy, and will be the first person to ever
be on the show twice!

   Meghan O'Keefe – Is a stand up comic
whose written for many reputable websites (HelloGiggles, The Hairpin,
Splitsider, The Apiary, OverthinkingIt, and many more!). She also
writes sketches, performs improv and see lots of shows. But you
should go to see her in shows, not watch her watch shows. That would
be creepy. See her Twitter.com/megsokay and her Tumblr

   Sharron Paul – There is very little
that Sharron doesn't do when it comes to comedy. She hosts and
produces comedy shows, and is a very talented and impactful stand-up
comedian as well. That is another way of saying she is funny as heck.
She prides herself on her realness, and this is what she will be
bringing to the NPCS. Check out her comedy on
