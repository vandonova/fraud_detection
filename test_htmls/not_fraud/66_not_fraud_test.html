   Are you interested in helping your students:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    imagine new possibilities of what they can do with computers?
   </li>
   <li>
    learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies?
   </li>
   <li>
    explore computational ideas through personally-meaningful projects?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Join us at the MIT Media Lab for this four-hour BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) workshop, where we will introduce you to Scratch, a programming environment that enables students to create interactive stories, games, animations, and simulations. As students create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively -- and develop as computational thinkers and computational creators.

   This event isÂ open to all Boston-area educators who have no prior Scratch experience. During this workshop, we will:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    explore the core ideas underlying Scratch
   </li>
   <li>
    experience Scratch through demonstrations and hands-on activities
   </li>
   <li>
    discuss strategies for integrating Scratch into classroom practice
   </li>
   <li>
    introduce you to
    <a href="http://scratched.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">
     ScratchEd
    </a>
    , the website where educators share their Scratch ideas, experiences, and resources
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   We particularly encourage educators from the same school, program, etc. to attend together as a group. Registration is limited to 40 people. The workshop is $10 and includes breakfast.
