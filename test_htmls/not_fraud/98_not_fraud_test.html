      BIKE SKILLS 101: LEARN TO RIDE (LTR) CLINICS
      <br/>
     </span>
    </span>
   </strong>
   These clinics are for everyone, NOT just the ladies and club members. ALL are welcome to register.
  </p>
  <p>
   This LTR clinic is the foundation of everything else you’ll learn on the bike. This is the clinic where we teach the old dogs new tricks and the newbies the fundamentals. You’ll learn about balance and weight distribution and how that affects your ability to ride your bike safely and confidently. We’ll learn skills like riding side by side, emergency stops, and how to look behind you while holding your line, drink and eat while riding in a group, rotating, drafting, how to steer, and counter-steer. We guarantee you’ll be a better bike handler and have much more fun on the bike.
   <br/>
   MUST be able to ride a bike.
  </p>
  <p>
   Highly recommended for anyone who is planning on cycling with others.
   <br/>
   **If there is demand for more clinics we will add them to the schedule.
