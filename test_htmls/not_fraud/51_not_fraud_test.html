    Osteopathic care of babies from birth to one year
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Working with babies is an increasing part of osteopathic clinical work. This course will give a firm grounding in eliciting a thorough case history, relevant examination and evaluation. This will give delegates confidence in their diagnosis and management plans for infants up to a year old. The course will include red flags and examination procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
   The emphasis will be on a thorough understanding of factors leading to common infant presentations. There will be case-based discussions about treatment approaches rather than practical training in specific techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
   Delegates will ideally have been in osteopathic practice for at least a year and have some experience of working with infants.

   This course is delivered by Andrea Rippe. Andrea gained her MSc Paediatric Osteopathy in 2007, and has been tutoring in the BSO paediatric clinics since then.
