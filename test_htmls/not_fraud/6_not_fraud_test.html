   <em>
    WHEN JEKYLL MET HYDE
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   The Magnetic Theatre in The Magnetic Field proudly presents the world premiere of
   <em>
    When Jekyll Met Hyde,
   </em>
   "a gleefully ridiculous take on the classic tale of passion," written and directed by Magnetic Theatre Artistic Director Steven Samuels.

  <p>
   Drawing on every written, dramatized, and filmed version of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic imaginable, and relevant 19th century literary and philosophical classics,
   <em>
    When Jekyll Met Hyde
   </em>
   features an unusual feminist twist and a surprise ending. To double the fun, and to honor the split personality at the heart of the story, The Magnetic Theatre is mounting two different productions simultaneously, one set in the 1950s, the other in the 1960s, with two different casts, in alternating repertory!
