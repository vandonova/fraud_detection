   monkeyface eel champion, blogger and street performer Kirk Lombard on an inter-
   <br/>
   tidal fishing trip along the city’s bayfront shoreline. Learn the basics of how to “poke pole” for the
   <br/>
   flavorful monkeyface eel, how to catch rock crabs and throw a “Hawaiian casting net.”
   <br/>
   Discover the best local mussel beds, where to find stands of edible sea weeds, discuss
   <br/>
   what’s running where and when and why. Learn what’s safe to eat and what’s not: why
   <br/>
   forage fish are better than sexy game fish, why a surf smelt is better than a jack smelt,
   <br/>
   why a kingfish shouldn’t be eaten in the summer, why the old wive’s tale about eating
   <br/>
   shellfish in months that have “r’s” in them could lead to your early (and painful) death
   <br/>
   by paralytic shellfish poisoning. Discuss how to catch and pickle herring (in season).
   <br/>
   Also included, will be a short trip along the real Fisherman’s Wharf, (yes, in addition
   <br/>
   to tee shirts, fish are actually bought and sold there) with a brief overview of our local
   <br/>
   commercial fisheries: historically, what fish have been caught in our region? What is
   <br/>
   being caught today? What is the relative sustainability of each local fishery? This tour
   <br/>
   will require a bit of walking and patience. If you can’t make it up the hill between Fort
   <br/>
   Mason and Municipal Pier, this tour isn’t for you. Also: there is no guarantee that fish
   <br/>
   will be caught—only that they will be discussed in great detail. Looking forward to
   <br/>
   seeing you out there!
