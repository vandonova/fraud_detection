   Our festival opens with a magnificent new film by the animation auteur who brought us "Kirikou and the Sorceress" and "Azur and Asmar." A hit at the Berlin Film Festival, the film weaves together six exotic fables that unfold in Tibet, medieval Europe, an Aztec kingdom, the African plains, and even the Land of the Dead. History blends with fairytale as viewers are whisked off to enchanted places populated by dragons, werewolves, captive princesses, sorcerers, and enormous talking bees - and each fable ends with a twist. Fall into the fabulous world of "Tales of the Nights" - a place where black silhouetted characters dance across Day-Glo backgrounds bursting with color and kaleidoscopic patterns.
