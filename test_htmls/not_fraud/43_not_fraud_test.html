   Background Information:
  </p>
  <p>
   Nellie's Catwalk for Kids (NC4K) was started back in 2006 by Nellie Krumlauf when she was 16 years old in the efforts of bringing childhood cancer to the forefront. The organization started off as just a summer fashion show wanting to get local kids and teens involved in helping make a magical difference. NC4K has now evolved to a 501 C3 non-profit that has four main community events a year including: a dance marathon, 5K run, golf outing, and the fashion show. In addition to community events NC4K has over 15 high school Nellie's Clubs all ran by upperclassmen. The first Nellie's Club was started back in 2009 by Jessica Soroky at Pickerington North High School; she is now the manager of all of the clubs and helping NC4K expand to other high schools. NC4K's mission is to actively help kids and teens and their families that are touched by cancer. The money raised from all of our events help us work in conjunction with Nationwide Children's Hospital Oncology Unit by supporting the families in every way possible. Funds raise also help us raise more awareness for pediatric cancer and grow the organization as a whole. NC4K's main goals are to inform communities of how they can help pediatric cancer families, to raise more funds for families with a child battling cancer, to empower kids, teens and young adults to make a difference, to eventually expand outside of Ohio to help other families, and the ultimate goal of helping find a cure!
