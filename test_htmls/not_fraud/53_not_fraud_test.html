     Helping women to become really effective decision makers includes their personal lives. This is often a matter of confidence and clout, both boosted by joining forces with other women.

     Where decisions are generally led by men and affect large chunks of society, engaging men in strenghtening their receptivity (the feminine principle) and the ability to listen without prejudice, works towards a true collaboration.

     Hence at the moment two different approaches and two separate TINDERBOX meetings. Please remember that the practices introduced at TINDERBOX are unusual. For some they're unusually powerful. Even if you think this is all very odd, there'll be something in it for you.

     You don't need to understand the language of TINDERBOX. It doesn't matter if your intellectual self dismisses or draws you back from reading this. Your body (without which your mind is after all somewhat adrift) needs the resources of the earth, the energy of the sun and the fire at the earth's core which helps to make our atmosphere. Engaging with those fundamentals, including gravity helps to make you feel at home in yourself, as yourself. And to feel a valued part of something.

     Come for an adventure. It will be entirely pleasurable unless you want your existing criteria to define where you are going, or even more discomforting, are certain that you already know and want to be seen as a knower. Think childhood. Think unselfconscious happy discovery. There are untapped resources in each of us, often bundled up, judged and made unavailable by reason. We properly value our capacity for logic and clear-thinking. That part often gets the casting vote. But there's also a wise, instinctual self every bit as useful. This is a less subjective resource, an 'inner tuition' accessed through awareness of what governs our bodies and makes us all equal. It's therefore inclusive, not only of other people but of other forms of life.

     Come to TINDERBOX to connect with the fire in the earth and in you. Come to experience a deeper rootedness, and the peace that arises. Come to contribute to the power of joined-up fire - the shared current flowing hip to hip in women, shoulder to shoulder in men.

     Each meeting will begin promptly at 7pm, and will begin with a short introduction. Then we'll move directly to the practice to connect individually and then collectively to core fire. THis is Â so that any discussion comes from a shared experience of a great resource, and is the foundation for subsequent periods of silence and listening with alert stillness.
