    Cattlemens is a casual, western-themed steakhouse chain. Founded in 1968 by a father-son team with decades of experience in the cattle business, eight locations now serve California. Still family-owned and operated, each location follows the "Cattlemens Code," offering the feel and flavor of the old west, aged and hand-cut beef, the finest ingredients, and old-fashioned Western hospitality. Serving generous portions and all-natural Harris Ranch beef, Cattlemens is always in good taste.

    Cattlemens is a classic California steakhouse with a tradition of Western hospitality and a reputation for quality, value and friendly service. Cattlemens is proud to exclusively serve Harris Ranch natural beef. We serve the same large-size steaks as when we first started three decades ago, and are one of a few restaurants that still ages all our beef on premises. You can't go wrong with our Famous 2-Pound Porterhouse, tender Filet Mignon, or the real "steal-of-a-deal", Pete's Special Steak Dinner.
