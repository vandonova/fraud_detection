   A new version of an old ceremony has emerged in the remote
Aboriginal community of Yuendumu. It's fought by warriors. It's called
football. And it's definitely more than a game. Aboriginal Rules is a
documentary from the producers of the award-winning Bush Mechanics. It
follows a year in the life of the Yuendumu Magpies Football team,
champions of their league from 2003-2005 – but can they do it for a
record-breaking fourth year in a row?

   A rare, behind-the-scenes look at the grass-roots Aboriginal football experience in Central Australia.
