    "The educational impact is huge, considering that 100 percent of those attending will gain a wealth of knowledge about lupus. 50+ The Second Half Magazine aims to raise the money to enable the foundation to continue aggressively funding research to find better treatment and eventually a cure to people affected by this disease. We're also providing a highly coveted chance to network." said Patricia.

    With over 80,000 people living in the tri-state area affected by lupus, the LFA offers 18 support groups, facilitates access to information and care via a Patient Navigator (one of the few chapters, nationally with this position) and assists patients through the Quality of Life fund that offers limited financial assistance to persons living with lupus.
