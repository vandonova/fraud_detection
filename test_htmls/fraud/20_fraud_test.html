   As you know, to remain successful, you must have a maintenance program. Just like a healthy and strong body; if you don’t continue to work out, you start slipping backwards. So - To fulfill this important need, we have developed a great “Success Achievement And Maintenance Program.” We call it the “Master Mind Alliance Success Clubs International.” At our M. M. A. Meetings we come together as a group to “Successercise.” - To continue studying and mastering success principles, brainstorm on how to solve problems and overcome obstacles, give support to each other, and to network with other success achievers.
