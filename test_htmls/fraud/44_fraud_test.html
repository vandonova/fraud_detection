   “The symbol of the heart lies at the heart of the symbolic world” R Guénon
  </p>
  <p>
   The interwined lives of two very different Colombian couples,
brought together by unexpected circumstances. A soldier is badly
injured by shrapnel from a landmine. Despite severe damage to his
heart, his life is saved by a cardiovascular surgeon. The soldier is
forced to retire from the army but, inspired by love for his new wife
and the child they are expecting, he battles to earn a living. At the
same time, the surgeon's wife is diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia.
Laced with symbolism and humour, this is a subtle examination of the
relationship between mortality and religion.

   On Thailand’s northern border with Burma, a Buddhist monk wages a
unique battle to save children from drugs and corruption. Phra Khru Ba
Neua Chai – a former soldier and Thai-boxing champion now better known
as 'The Tiger Monk' – runs a monastery taking in homeless and abandoned
children, often the victims of drug addiction or trafficking. Based in
the notorious 'Golden Triangle' border region, rife with drugs and
warring gangs, he has been attacked many times by local gangsters for
persuading locals to grow vegetables instead of opium. But he continues
his work regardless, teaching Buddhist compassion... and a little
Thai-boxing.
