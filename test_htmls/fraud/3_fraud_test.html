  <p>
   London connection arranged the first exhibition for buying properties
 in Spain at the World Trade Centre, WTC, in the Swedish capital of 
Stockholm in October 2007. This first and relatively small exhibition 
attracted 1.500 visitors and proved to be a great success for the 14 
exhibitors, who were delighted when London Connection arranged another 
successful fair in the spring of 2008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The interest among 
professionals in the international property market grew rapidly. London Connection therefore invited exhibitors from all over the world
 to participate in the autumn exhibition of 2009, now under the name of 
“Buying Properties Abroad”.
  </p>
  <p>
   By Autumn 2010, the exhibitions had 
grown to such an extent, that there was a need to move to a larger 
exhibition hall and Olympia Exhibition Hall has been the home ever since for Real Estate exhibitions in London, the flag ship and the largest of London connection exhibitions, Buying Properties Abroad.

over 20 different countries and are made up by agents, constructors and
